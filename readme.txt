This was my final project for my Intro CS class. 

It's a simulator of a basic macroeconomy, that allows a user to adjust macroeconomic variables such as...
  -Government Spending
  -Investments 
  -Net Exports
  -Marginal Propensity to Consume
  -Taxes
 
...and see basic graphical macroeconomic displays on an Aggregate demand graph, as well as a Price/Agg. Demmand/ AGg. Supply graph
  
The calcuatations are based on arbitrary values for these variables.
